Crusader Kings III BBR Music mod

This mod adds 42 hand-picked ambient medieval tracks, mostly from Medieval II Total War, as well as 20 from Crusader Kings II on top of the vanilla ones.

They are generic Euro-centric ambient tracks and they don't have culture or religion-based triggers.

It is Ironman compatible and should be compatible with any other mods.

All rights to this beautiful music belong to their legal owners, not me. This is just a collection to enhance the game experience.
